If you are reading this, it is unlikely you are unaware of the COVID-19 pandemic. Either way, before quantifying the effects of this pandemic let's consider what led us to this state.

COVID-19 (short for Coronavirus Disease 2019) is a virus [believed](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200317175442.htm) to have developed in Wuhan, China in 2019. It looks like this using Transmission Electron Microscope:

Viruses are the smallest infectious microbes composed of DNA/RNA surrounded by a protein shell. When a virus enters a living cell it modifies the cell's actions. It can force the cell to produce more viruses which can burst out of the host cell, killing the host cell and going on to infect other cells. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DGwOJXSxqg) for more information. COVID-19 (as well as SARS and the common cold) is a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a class of viruses with spiky projections on their outer surface. These spikes are protein receptors that allow the virus to attach and enter host cells. Determining the molecular structure of these proteins may lead to the development of a successful vaccine as described [here](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-spike-protein-structure.html).
