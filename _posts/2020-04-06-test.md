If you are reading this, it is unlikely you are unaware of the COVID-19 pandemic. Either way, before quantifying the effects of this pandemic let's consider what led us to this state.

COVID-19 (short for Coronavirus Disease 2019) is a virus [believed](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200317175442.htm) to have developed in Wuhan, China in 2019. It looks like this using Transmission Electron Microscope:

Viruses are the smallest infectious microbes composed of DNA/RNA surrounded by a protein shell. When a virus enters a living cell it modifies the cell's actions. It can force the cell to produce more viruses which can burst out of the host cell, killing the host cell and going on to infect other cells. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DGwOJXSxqg) for more information. COVID-19 (as well as SARS and the common cold) is a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a class of viruses with spiky projections on their outer surface. These spikes are protein receptors that allow the virus to attach and enter host cells. Determining the molecular structure of these proteins may lead to the development of a successful vaccine as described [here](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-spike-protein-structure.html).

So far it appears the infection and death rate for COVID-19 is larger than the flu. However, this number has varied widely across the world indicating it depends on other factors. See [this article](https://www.livescience.com/new-coronavirus-compare-with-flu.html) for more information. 

It is easy to deny the reality of an issue when it is not immediately physical (e.g. on your doorstep). Towards this end, let's take a look at the current data and project into the future.

As the availability and use of COVID testing has widely varied across the globe, the number of cases is not well understood, or at least comparable between regions. On the other hand, death rates from COVID appear to be more accurate so far. Looking at the number of deaths so far in the plot below, we can see that the outbreak began in Hubei. It began in Europe about a month later, and in the US another two weeks later.

We can also see how this outbreak developed spatially in the US by plotting the number of deaths vs. date here:

From this plot it is hard to compare the death rates, since each country has a different population. So let's look at the number of deaths per one million people:

![Total Deaths per Million vs. Date](/data/covid_plots/total_deaths_per_mil.png)

Note in all the GIFs gray areas have no cases or data for the plotted time period and black areas are 'off the charts.'

Now we can see that so far the percentage of people that died from COVID is largest in Hubei, followed by Italy and King County, WA. The steep slope of the other countries, is not encouraging. However, looking at South Korea we can see that they have significantly decreased their death rate through their mitigation strategies.

However, it is still a bit difficult to compare the outbreaks in each country, since COVID hit each country at different times. So let's define 'CV Outbreak days' as the number of days since 10 COVID deaths and plot this against the total number of deaths:

![Total Deaths vs. CV Days](/data/covid_plots/total_deaths_raw_covid_days_log.png)
![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/tashwoods/tashwoods.github.io/master/data/covid_plots/total_deaths_cv_days.gif)

Plotted next to each area is the COVID growth rate (calculated as the slope of the linear fit plotted as the dashed line). From this plot South Korea is 'winning.' However, it is still hard to compare countries when we do not normalize the number of deaths by the population. So again, let's look at the number of deaths per one million people vs outbreak days. In this case, outbreak days are defined as the number of days since one death per million people.

![Deaths per Mil vs CV Days](/data/covid_plots/deaths_per_mil_per_mil_covid_days_log.png)
![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/tashwoods/tashwoods.github.io/master/data/covid_plots/deaths_per_mil_cv_days.gif)

Now we can see that South Korea has contained the outbreak the most with a growth rate of 1.05, while the US has the largest growth rate, at 1.25. Idealistically, if the US was able to 'flatten the curve,' matching South Korea's growth rate ~1,500 lives would be saved in Los Angeles County.

But it is still easy to think one person's actions do not contribute much (e.g. it's fine if I don't self isolate). So let's break down these numbers more. Assuming each person contributes equally to their countries growth rate (which is not true, but we will start with this assumption). Then calculating the difference between a South Korean's individual contribution to the growth rate and an American, we have the change to the American growth rate due to one individual. Plotting the changes in the number of deaths in Los Angeles if one person acts like a South Korean we have:

However, these approximations assume that the number of deaths grows exponentially indefinitely. This is obviously not the case - we cannot kill more people than there are. There are various models for pandemics (e.g. SIR), but let's start simply by fitting to a sigmoid curve, which is a decent first approximation. Fitting the number of deaths per million people to a sigmoid per area we have:

Individual actions do matter and can weaken this pandemic. As Dr. Deborah Birx [said](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/823916343/coronavirus-task-force-set-to-detail-the-data-that-led-to-extension-of-guideline) we currently have 'no magic bullet, it's just our behaviors that dictate the course of this viral pandemic over the next thirty days.'
